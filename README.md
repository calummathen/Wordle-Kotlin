# Wordle (Kotlin Training Project)

This is a simple implementation of the popular word-guessing game, **Wordle**. Originally developed by Josh Wardle, Wordle challenges players to guess a 5-letter word in six attempts. Each guess provides feedback on whether letters are correct and in the right position or appear elsewhere in the word.

This project was built as a training exercise to learn **Kotlin** and Android development.
